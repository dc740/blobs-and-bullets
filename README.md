A small browser game written in Rust.

It is a local co-op twin-stick shooter, where you and your friend can try to defeat a horde of blobby monsters.

This is my first non-trivial Rust project.  

## Install and run

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

I have written a post on my new homepage about my experience writing this game: [Rust, WebAssembly and web-sys](https://rhmoller.dev/posts/2020/my-experience-with-rust-and-websys/)
